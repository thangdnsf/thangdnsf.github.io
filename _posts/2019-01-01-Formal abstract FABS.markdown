tags: [Formal-abstract,Lean-prover]
sum: "The Formal Abstracts project was initiated by Thomas Hales in 2017. See his talk Big conjectures from the Big Proof meeting in Cambridge.

A formal abstract, or fabstract for short, is a formalization of the main results (constructions, definitions, proofs, conjectures) of a piece of informal mathematics, such as a research paper. There is no requirement that the entire text be formalized. Proofs of statements are omitted. A formal abstract is not the formalization of the abstract itself.<br>
