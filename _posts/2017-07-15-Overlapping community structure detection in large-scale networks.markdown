In recent years, with the rapid growth of network scale, it is a difficult task to detect overlapping communities in large-scale networks for state of the art methods. This method is implemented in the Apache Spark framework for its power in distributed parallel computation."

### Overview
This is a my undergraduate thesis. In project, I provide a general view of communities and its the real life applications. In recent years, with the rapid growth of network scale, it is a difficult task to detect overlapping communities in large-scale networks for state of the art methods. This method is implemented in the Apache Spark framework for its power in distributed parallel computation.
